# IoT Hazardous Gas Monitoring and Control System in Poultry Farming 🐓🌍

This project monitors hazardous gases (like ammonia) in poultry farms using an **ESP8266 WiFi module** and an **MQ2 gas sensor**.  
When unsafe gas levels are detected, the system **automatically turns on a ventilator** for circulation, while a **buzzer and LED indicators** provide local alerts.  
The project also integrates with the **Blynk IoT platform** for real-time monitoring and notifications.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time detection of hazardous gases
- Automatic ventilator control for safety
- Buzzer + LED indicators for local alerts
- Remote monitoring via **Blynk mobile dashboard**
- Scalable design for larger poultry setups

## 🛠️ Components Used
- ESP8266 WiFi Module  
- MQ2 Gas Sensor  
- Ventilator (fan)  
- Buzzer & LED indicators  
- Blynk IoT Platform  

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The MQ2 sensor detects gas levels in the environment.  
2. The ESP8266 processes the data and compares it with a set threshold.  
3. If gas concentration is high:  
   - A **ventilator** is activated automatically  
   - A **buzzer and LED** are triggered for alerts  
   - Data is sent to the **Blynk IoT app** for remote monitoring

## 📊 Future Enhancements
- AI/ML-based adaptive threshold detection  
- Cloud data logging for long-term analysis  
- Integration of multiple sensors for better coverage
